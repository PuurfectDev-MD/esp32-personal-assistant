# Personal Assistant Project

This project combines **ESP32 hardware** (running MicroPython) with a **Python server** on my laptop.

## Structure
- `esp32/` → ESP32 code for the assistant
- `server/` → PC-side server code
- `README.md` → this file (documentation)

## How to Run
1. Flash ESP32 with MicroPython.
2. Upload code from `esp32/` folder.
3. Run `python server/main.py` to start the server.
